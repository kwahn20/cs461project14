# This program reads in integers until a negative integer is entered.
# It then outputs the sum of the positive integers.

main:   
    li $t0, 0   # initialize the sum to 0
loop:   
    li $v0 5
    syscall     # read next int into $v0
    bltz $v0 endloop  # exit the loop if the int entered (in $v0) is negative
    add $t0, $t0, $v0 # add the next int to the sum
    b loop

endloop: 
    move $a0, $t0
    li $v0, 1
